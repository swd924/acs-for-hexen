# acs-for-hexen
C-based language for scripting events in Hexen

https://zdoom.org/wiki/ACS

This wiki has a reference for all commands and it's what I used to make
my code.

Why use this repository?

1 - The wiki mostly concerns ZDoom ACS, not Hexen ACS. The differences
  between the styles, as I've found, are minor, but they're enough to
  become a pain for someone new to ACS
  
2 - Very few of the wiki's examples show combinations of code. The purpose
  of this repository isn't to be a list of commands, but mostly to show
  how they can be combined to form events which could be useful in your
  level-building
  
3 - A wiki is meant to be a reference, not a tutorial for absolute
  beginners. The target audience of my code is beginners who need
  more examples for how to use the info from the wiki
  
4 - Don't use the repository INSTEAD of the wiki. Use it as a supplement
